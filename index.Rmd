I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics at the [Colorado School of Public Health](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/Pages/default.aspx) on the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/). I work collaboratively within the [Center for Innovative Design and Analysis](cida.ucdenver.edu) and serve as the Director of the [Pulmonary Translational Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Core](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/pulmonary/research/ptrac). 

My methodological research interests include model selection, model transparency/interpretability, methods for missing data, statistical computation, data preprocessing, and post-selection inference. Additionally, I enjoy writing and thinking about best practices for statistical collaboration, and I have developed a curriculum for training the next generation of statistical consultants (see, for example [statCTR](https://www.statctr.com)). When I'm not researching or teaching, I enjoy attending live concerts, going out for pizza, and hiking in the mountains.
