I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics at the [Colorado School of Public Health](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/Pages/default.aspx) on the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/). I work collaboratively within the [Center for Innovative Design and Analysis](cida.ucdenver.edu) as well as the [Pulmonary Translational Core](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/pulmonary/research/ptrac). 

Prior to my current appointment, I received his PhD from the University of Iowa in biostatistics. My primary research interest relates to expanding model selection tools to be useful when searching for important statistical interactions and other derived variables in modeling contexts. The successful application of my methodology translates to predictive models that are more transparent than their black-box counterparts. In addition to model selection, I am also interested in the modeling of time-to-event or multi-state data, study design optimization, statistical computation, high-dimensional data analysis, and missing data methods.
 
I have broad experience consulting and collaborating for a wide range of projects, having held numerous successful collaborative positions and teaching roles. In these endeavors, I like to emphasize the need for all members of the team to satisfactorily understand and to be able to communicate statistical results and inferences. My applied research experience is broad, including pulmonary sciences, forecasting the flu, using large claims databases (e.g. NIS, NEDS, Truven) to show novel seasonality of certain conditions and infectious diseases, and predicting the progression of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (just to name a few). When I'm not researching, I enjoy attending live concerts, going out for pizza, and burning off the pizza calories while hiking or skiing in the mountains.
