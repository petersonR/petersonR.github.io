## Data Diction Blog

I infrequently post blogs to [Data Diction](https://data-diction.com/). So far I've posted about Denver's "Zero Fare for Better Air" policy (whether it actually worked), and a how-to for selecting interactions and polynomials, but I hope to continue finding interesting applications of data that I can write about there more freely than I can in academic journals. Please contact me if you are interested in writing a post for this blog, or collaborating on a piece. 

## StatCTR

The [Statistical Consulting Training Repository](https://statCTR.com) includes indexed, vetted videos and online resources. I collaborated with Julia Sharp and Emily Griffith to build this resource and have recently integrated it within the American Statistical Association's [Statistical Consulting Section](https://community.amstat.org/cnsl/home).
