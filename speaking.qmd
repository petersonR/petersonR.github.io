# Workshops

- **Statistical communication and leadership**. I developed the material for and taught the second day of this two-day in-person workshop at the University of Michigan through the [ABS Network](https://absnetwork.org/). This workshop was co-developed by [Paula Caproni](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/paula-caproni) and [Mary Sammel](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/resources/directory/directory-profile/Sammel-Mary-UCD6003095529). See the [ad](https://us12.campaign-archive.com/?e=__test_email__&u=76594bec23960643f372c1059&id=a989fbf721) for more details.

- **Statistical communication and leadership**. With Paula Caproni and Mary Sammel, we adapted our workshop into a short-form, web-based course sponsored by the Quantitative Staff Network (QSN). I virtually led day 2 of this workshop in October 2024; more information available [here](https://mailchi.mp/527da02ca0fb/quantitative-scientific-staff-national-network-qs2n2-upcoming-webinar-15394242?e=5196b99255).

- **Identifying and addressing research misconduct as a collaborative statistician**. I developed and led a 90-minute workshop for all collaborative statisticians attending the 2024 ACTStat annual meeting in Portland, Oregon.

-	**Collaborator phenotyping**. I led focus groups on this topic at the 2022 ACTStat Annual Meeting consisting of two 1.5-hour sessions with 25 participants in Washington, D.C. These findings were later generalized and published [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sta4.694).
