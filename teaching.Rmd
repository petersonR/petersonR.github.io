# Workshop

I developed the material for and taught the second day of a 2-day workshop on Statistical Communication and Leadership. This two-day in-person workshop was delivered to an audience of about 40 post-graduate statisticians at the University of Michigan through the [ABS Network](https://absnetwork.org/). See the [ad](https://us12.campaign-archive.com/?e=__test_email__&u=76594bec23960643f372c1059&id=a989fbf721) for more details.
