    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics at the Colorado School of Public Health on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. I work collaboratively within the Center for Innovative Design and Analysis and serve as the Director of the Pulmonary Translational Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Core.\nMy methodological research interests include model selection, model transparency/interpretability, methods for missing data, statistical computation, data preprocessing, and post-selection inference. Additionally, I enjoy writing and thinking about best practices for statistical collaboration, and I have developed a curriculum for training the next generation of statistical practitioners. When I’m not researching or teaching, I enjoy spending time with my hilarious kids, playing disc golf, attending live concerts, going out for pizza, and hiking in the mountains.\nI currently serve as the Chair-Elect of the American Statistical Association’s Statistical Consulting Section (2025-2027). This year (2025) I plan to attend the Translational Science 2025 conference (Washington D.C), the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM 2025) in Nashville, and the Association for Clinical and Translational Statisticians (ACTStat) pre-JSM Meeting. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect."
